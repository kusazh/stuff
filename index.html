            for game flow management, and generated the required bitmap text

            The game and the web page used the 8x8 bitmap font

            one tile. With this correspondence, events could be placed on
            characters, triggering scene transitions when player move onto them,
            creating a gameplay mechanic reminiscent of “hyperlink”.
